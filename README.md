# SQUADMASTER 

SQUADMASTER is a Sports Management System developed by our team "pip install life". It helps in managing data of students representing their college in sports. The app has separate sections for viewers and coordinators. The viewers can see all the players for the college, and coordinators can add, view or delete players by logging in. Coordinators are created by Sports Coordinator at end of year. It is an innovative solution to the problem of inadequate documentation of sports data in colleges.
